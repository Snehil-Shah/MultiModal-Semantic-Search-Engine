  <h1 align="center">Multi-Modal Image Search Engine</h1>
  <p align="center">
    A Semantic Search Engine that understands the Content & Context of your Queries. 
    <br>
    Use Multi-Modal inputs like Text-Image or a Reverse Image Search to Query a Vector Database of over 15k Images. <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/Snehil-Shah/Multimodal-Image-Search-Engine">Try it Out!</a>

<h3>‚Ä¢ About The Project</h3>

At its core, the Search Engine is built upon the concept of **Vector Similarity Search**.
All the Images are encoded into vector embeddings based on their semantic meaning using a Transformer Model, which are then stored in a vector space.
When searched with a query, it returns the nearest neighbors to the input query which are the relevant search results.

We use the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) Model by OpenAI which is a Pre-trained Multi-Modal Vision Transformer that can semantically encode Words, Sentences & Images into a 512 Dimensional Vector. This Vector encapsulates the meaning & context of the entity into a *Mathematically Measurable* format.

The Images are stored as vector embeddings in a Qdrant Collection which is a Vector Database. The Search Term is encoded and run as a query to Qdrant, which returns the Nearest Neighbors based on their Cosine-Similarity to the Search Query.

**The Dataset**: All images are sourced from the [Open Images Dataset](https://github.com/cvdfoundation/open-images-dataset) by Common Visual Data Foundation.
